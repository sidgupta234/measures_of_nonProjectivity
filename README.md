# measures_of_nonProjectivity
The modules "main_random_shorts_ar.py", "main_random_shorts_ar_arity.py", and "main_random_shorts_ar_topology.py" takes a directory containing conllu format files and generates random trees for baseline-1, baseline-2 and baseline-3 respectively. The calculated measures i.e., arity, projection degree, gap degree, etc. are stores in same output file for both real and random baseline trees. The output file gets generated in long format.

To install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
