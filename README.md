# measures_of_nonProjectivity
The module "main_random_shorts_ar.py" takes a directory containing conllu format files and generates random baseline trees. This baseline generates trees with pruefer code and controls for the rate of crossing dependencies. The calculated measures i.e., arity, tree depth, gap degree, etc. are stored in same output file for both real and random baseline trees. The output file gets generated in long format.

The module "baseline_conditions_nCross.py" contains random tree generation code. 

To install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
